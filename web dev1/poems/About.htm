    Taggingnature is all about nature,
    it’s beauty, serenity and the motion of life
    that keeps on moving, no matter what 
    and I am Ayush Kumar Saxena, just a guy who sees things 
    and tries to understand their emotions. 
    No matter how hard you work or how bad your day was,
    at the end you are always thankful to the Nature,
    for showing you the Colors of life,
    for giving you peace in the wake of storm,
    for soothing you in difficult times,
    It’s the nature’s beauty and the emotions 
    that I find in them that inspires me to write my poetry,
    this blog is just a way to express my gratitude towards the nature.

    Love
    Ayush
