Journey of India,A country so bright,
Always humble,a nation so might.
History of India,a humongous tale,
Vaster than the Ocean and the ships that sail.

Journey to the Mountains High,
The breathtaking beauty, makes me sigh.
The beautiful farms of Apple and Strawberries,
Delicious fruits and sweet cherries.
Beauty and Pride go hand in hand,
At World's highest battleground,Our Warriors stand.

Journey to Kolkata in East,
The City of Joy and people so sweet.
Celebrations so colorful,Festivals so bright.
Food so delicious,lifestyle so light.

Journey to the desert in West,
History of Great Kingdoms rest.
Stories of Warriors so brave,
Dust and sand now covers their grave.
The shrine of Somnath stands tall,
Lord Shiva blesses us all.

Journey to the destinations South,
Home to sea ports,India's mouth.
Land of Shrines and heartful devotion,
Industrial Complexes and disciplined commotion.

Journey to the Lands North East,
A hub of culture,an experience to feast.
The people,lovely,fair and just,
Far away but in India they trust.
Skilled warriors and brave fighters,
Talent marksmen and expert archers.

Journey to the India's soul,
Delhi is the reflection of it all,
Mumbai the Industrial Powerhouse,
Day and night, the nation arouse.

Problems and conflicts are tough and grave,
Solving them is what we crave.

Journey of India,A country so bright,
Always humble,a nation so might
