        <em>
The Rising Sun shines might and bright,
For the end of the dark,it brings light.
From the horizon, it signals the dark,
Glide away or see the spark.

Power it has to burn all gloom,
For all evil, it comes as doom.
Sun rises and so does life,
After a strenuous survival strife.

Birds and animals chirp around,
Bright yellow sunlight when surrounds.
Chilly, foggy mornings do appear,
Patience is the key to steer.

Wait is long, but the sun would come,
Shiny bright the day would become.
Treasures of life, the sun beholds,
Sometimes days may turn cold.
Patience and Efforts would show the way,
till everythingâ€™s gay.

Rising sun shines might and bright,
For the end of darkness, it brings light.</em>
