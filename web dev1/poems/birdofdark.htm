Fly fly, the bird of dark,
Why so scared to see the spark?
Tell me my friend, what frights you?
Maybe, I can feel it too.

The lovely bird, in a shivering voice,
Said go away, I hate this noise,
Sunken in the darkest corner,
He thought of me as a foreigner.

I could see the pain, he was in,
Sat beside, to make him feel kin.
Slowly, I brushed his feather,
Hoping for it to make him feel better.

The kind act worked and he opened his heart,
Gave his striking story, a magnificent start.
A beautiful bird flew high in sky,
Until it was caught in here to die.
He tried his best to break out free,
But there was no light where he could see.

Broken and tired, he sat aside,
Remembering the world’s beautiful sight.
Recalling the days when he flew over gardens,
Enjoying with his friends and eating bitter almonds.

Tears rolled down his eyes,
Realizing his helplessness, he chose to keep quiet.
Taken aback by the grave story,
I asked him to come with me and see the glory.

The little bird, refused to join,
Said, “dark has now scarred my soul”,
Now it was my turn, to toss the coin,
Steady and firm, I caught his hold.

Took him out in the shining sun,
and the mighty lord treated his soul,
He tried his best to run back to the dark,
But his savior stood between him and his goal.

After some time he was fine with light,
Thanked me for hearing his plight,
He relished the sight and loved the freedom,
His friends came back and he enjoyed the stardom.

The bird once dark, had now become golden,
Ready to fly, with wings which had broadened.

He bid goodbye and flew towards the sea,
I shouted and said,
Remember, You’ve always got a friend in me.
