Oh Dear, The Winds of Life,
Flying with you is what I strive,
The way you blow, gives me will,
Your paucity brings my life to standstill,

Oh Dear, The Winds of Life,
Take me with you,
Let the new destinations arrive.
Sometimes your strength, takes me high,
At others, your absence makes me cry.
You change directions and so does my life,
Sometimes at pinnacle,at others in strife.

Oh Dear, The Winds of Life,
Why do you turn and make me drive?
Although I love the roller coaster ride,
Your utter uncertainty, makes my head go from side to side.
I hope you take me places afar,
To the end of suffering and beginning of the par.

Oh Dear, The Winds of Life,
Flying with you is what i strive.
        </em>
