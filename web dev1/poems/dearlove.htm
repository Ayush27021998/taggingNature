Dear Love,The poet's poetry,
In the darkest hour,You bring the life some symmetry.
The innocent hearts,do you steal,
Fire and Strength,do you reveal.
An ocean of emotions and sky of hope,
Dear Love,You hold me together like rope.

Dear Love,The writer's story,
In the brightest hour,You share the glory.
Calm and Serene,do you appear,
Bring some peace and help me steer.
Above the Mountains in the sparkling sky,
Dear Love, with you,I would love to fly.

Dear Love,An artists art,
You give the day,a beautiful start.
Result of great imagination and hard-work,
You catch people's eyes and leave them awestruck.
Beside the plains,Along the strip,
Dear Love,with you,I would love a road-trip.

Dear Love,A Comedian's Comedy,
You,my dear,keep my life steady.
Made from the heart,you bring me fun,
Beautiful by nature, just like a Heron.
Along the shore,at the sunset,
Dear Love,I would love to sit beside and have a chat.

Dear Love,A singer's song,
Soft at places,at others so strong.
Born from beautiful voice and words,
Without the lovely singer,
You are just a verse.
Atop the hill, under the Moonshine,
Dear Love, You make me feel divine.
        </em>
